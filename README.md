</p>

I'm starting a journey to build random stuff, apply and practice Backend Engineering, I will go from a Monolithic application to a Microservices exploring and building cool stuff and Proof of Concepts. ðŸš€ðŸ’»

## Week 1

during this week I will discover and learn kubernetes, and how to deploy a simple application to it.

I will build a simple api application with express and then deploy it to kubernetes. including a database and redis cache.

the api will be a **Incantogamus app** a simple CRUD application for video games.

**Incantogamus**: is a whimsical and imaginary word created with a mix of Latin and whimsy, inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter. However, in terms of actual meaning, it doesn't have a specific definition or translation as it's a made-up term. It's intended to evoke a sense of enchantment and mystery, fitting for a magical word related to games in the Harry Potter universe.

### To Do

#### project: https://github.com/civilcoder55/incantogamus

</p>

- [x] Dockerize the application
- [x] Deploy the application to kubernetes

  I deployed the application to a kubernetes cluster on my local machine using minikube. the cluster look like this:
  <p align="center">

  </p>

  created an ingress to expose the application to the outside world, and made a domain point to the minikube node ip address.
