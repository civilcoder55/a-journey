</p>

I'm starting a journey to build random stuff, apply and practice Backend Engineering, I will go from a Monolithic application to a Microservices exploring and building cool stuff and Proof of Concepts. ðŸš€ðŸ’»

## Week 1

during this week I will discover and learn kubernetes, and how to deploy a simple application to it.

I will build a simple api application with express and then deploy it to kubernetes. including a database and redis cache.

the api will be a **Incantogamus app** a simple CRUD application for video games.

**Incantogamus**: is a whimsical and imaginary word created with a mix of Latin and whimsy, inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter. However, in terms of actual meaning, it doesn't have a specific definition or translation as it's a made-up term. It's intended to evoke a sense of enchantment and mystery, fitting for a magical word related to games in the Harry Potter universe.

#### To Do

- [ ] Create a simple api application with express
- [ ] Dockerize the application
- [ ] Deploy the application to kubernetes
- [ ] Discover and play with kubernetes features
